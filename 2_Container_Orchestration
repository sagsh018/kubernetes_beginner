1) What is container orchestration
    a) Underlying platform with the set of resources and capabilities, that orchestrate the connectivity between the containers and automatically
        scale up or down based on the load
        This whole process of automatically deploying and managing containers is known as container orhestration
2) Orchestration Technologies
    a) Docker swarm
    b) kubernetes
    c) MESOS
3) Advantages of contaier orchestration
    a) Application highy available, as the hardware failure will not the bring the application down as you will have be haing multiple instances
        of same application running on multiple node 
    b) The user traffic is load balanced accros the differnt containers 
    c) When demand increases, we could deploy more instances of the applications seamlessly within the matter of seconds and we have an ability
        to do that at a service level.
    d) When we run out of hardware resources, we could scale the number of underlying nodes up or down without having to take down the application
4) kubernetes
    it is a container orchestration technology used to orchestrate the deployment and management of hundreds and thousands of containers in a 
    clustred environment
